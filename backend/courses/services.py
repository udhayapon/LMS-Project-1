    Auto-enroll one student into all TeachingAssignments that match their
    course + year + semester. Skips duplicates. Returns the number created.

    Today every subject is core, so a student is enrolled into everything for
    their course-semester. When electives arrive (Subject.is_elective), add
    `.exclude(subject__is_elective=True)` here so only core subjects are
    auto-enrolled and electives are left for student self-enrollment.
