"""
Team-based mentor allocation.

    student   joins a team (one A, one B, one C, plus the department fallback)
    advisor   places whoever did not join, closes formation, picks a mentor
              per team, sends the batch to the HOD
    HOD       sets the rules, then approves through hod_decide_proposals

Kept out of views.py so that file stays readable. Submitting writes ordinary
MentorAllocation rows, so Allocation History and the change-request flow need
no changes at all.
