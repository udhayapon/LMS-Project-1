"""
events/holidays.py

The single source of holiday dates for the whole system.

Holidays live in the academic calendar (events.CalendarEvent, event_type
'holiday'). Exams, teaching plans, and the timetable all read them from HERE —
never from their own copy — so a holiday entered once in the calendar is seen
everywhere, and the Google-synced national holidays count too.

A CalendarEvent holiday may span several days (start_date .. end_date). Both
helpers expand that range, so a week-long break blocks every day in it, not
just the first.
